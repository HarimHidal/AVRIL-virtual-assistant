# avril-virtual-assistant
This repository contains files to run AVRIL, a reduced virtual assistant with a simple yet intuitive voice interface designed to work in spanish. The functionalities implemented here include:
- using the microphone to collect voice commands,
- converting speech to text (using the Google Speech services) and vice versa,
- parsing the the voice command in search of keywords to complete the requests,
- reading configurations from .txt files and controlling the keyboard,
- writing dictations to WhatsApp, Sticky Notes and the clipboard,
- opening files, directories, websites, apps and executables by name,
- completing Google and Wikipedia searches,
- searching songs on Spotify and playing videos on YouTube,
- setting an online timer and much more!

Additional notes:
- Please be sure to download the .txt files as well and save them to the same directory as the script (you may need to update those .txt configuration files too).
- You may also need to install some of the python modules in your machine to run the script, to do so, you can use: pip install [ name of the module ]
- If you need help, just say 'ayuda' and AVRIL will tell you all the keywords availabe as well as how to use them in the cmd window.
